Demo and explanation of the original script at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwGiwDLQ40A&list=WL<br>

⚠⚠⚠<br>
Original script should work on .FBX models but i didn't manage to make it work correctly.<br>
The author says "Put it (the script) on a game object with a mesh filter and renderer. Make sure to have read/write enabled on fbx import"<br>
From what I've understood you have to enable reas/write on the model you import and it should have mesh filter and renderer<br>
