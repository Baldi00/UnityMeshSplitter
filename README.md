Demo and explanation of the original script at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwGiwDLQ40A&list=WL<br>

⚠⚠⚠<br>
Original script should work on .FBX models but <ins><b>I didn't manage</b></ins> to make it work correctly.<br>
The author says "Put it (the script) on a game object with a mesh filter and renderer. Make sure to have read/write enabled on fbx import"<br>
From what I've understood you have to enable read/write on the model you import and it should have mesh filter and renderer<br>
In my case I got ```ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException``` or other errors. Good luck
